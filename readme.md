# Lensless In-line Holography Simulation and Experimental Validation

This repository contains simulation codes and experimental report for a **lensless in-line holography system**, developed as part of my Master research project at Institut Polytechnique de Paris.  
The goal is to model light propagation, hologram's acquisition and recording, and image reconstruction based on iterative phase retrieval algorithm, complemented by an experimental laboratory setup.

## Features

- Light propagation: using angular spectrum method.
- Hologram acquisition and recording: with noise and pixel integration effect.
- Image reconstruction: using the iterative phase retrieval (IPR) algorithm.
- Experimental validation: building a working laboratory setup.
